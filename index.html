          <h3>What is InnCrisis</h3>

<p>In the immediate aftermath of a natural disasters it can be a challenge for response agencies to find shelter for people who have been displaced. It's often the case that emergency shelters reach capacity while nearby hotels have excess capacity. Wouldn't it be great if there was an easy system for aid workers to place people in nearby hotels?</p>

<p>At present, InnCrisis is a turnkey web application for raising funds that can then be easily dispersed to people needing shelter when natural disasters strike. Future developments may include a mobile web app interface for aid workers to search for and directly book hotel rooms using the funds that have been raised via their agencies deployment of InnCrisis.</p>

<h3>Development Status</h3>

<p>The first version of InnCrisis, currently under development, is a proof of concept focused exclusively on fundraising and fund disbursement functionality using WePay as a backend. A working demo will soon be available at <a href="http://demo.inncrisis.com/">http://demo.inncrisis.com/</a></p>

<p>If this project proves to be a viable platform for deployment by aid agencies, we will continue development to include functionality such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Administration tools for tracking donations</li>
<li>Native mobile apps for fund dispersal by aid workers</li>
<li>A way for donors to get feedback on the impact of their donation</li>
<li>Hotel search and booking functionality</li>
</ul><h3>History</h3>

<p>The InnCrisis project began it's life on 3 November 2012 at the <a href="http://hurricanehackers.com">HurricaneHackers</a>/CrisisCamp Boston event held at the MIT Media Lab. In the aftermath of hurricane Sandy, the NYC Office of Emergency Management had put in a request for a hotel availability platform to streamline the process of sheltering people displaced by disasters like hurricane Sandy. </p>

<p>A bunch of us at the November 3rd event started hacking away at this problem and decided we had a pretty cool solution we wanted to continue developing.</p>

<p>The current dev team for InnCrisis is Ryan Kahn (<a href="https://github.com/Myztiq" class="user-mention">@Myztiq</a>), Jonathan Wilde (<a href="https://github.com/speedbreeze" class="user-mention">@speedbreeze</a>) and Lyre Calliope (<a href="https://github.com/CaptainCalliope" class="user-mention">@CaptainCalliope</a>).</p>
