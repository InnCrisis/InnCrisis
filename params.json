{"name":"InnCrisis","tagline":"","body":"### What is InnCrisis\r\nInnCrisis is a deployable fundraising application that enables aid agencies to directly inform their donors of the impact of their specific donations.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\n1. An aid agency deploys the InnCrisis software on infrastructure under their control.\r\n2. Donors visit the web page created by this InnCrisis deployment and donate funds.\r\n3. Aid workers use a mobile app to disperse and document the dispersal of funds.  \r\n4. Recipients of funds can thank donors directly while maintaining their privacy. \r\n5. Donors receive feedback on the impact of their donations thereby increasing the likelyhood of making future donations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Development Status\r\n\r\nThe first version of InnCrisis, currently under development, is a proof of concept focused exclusively on the core fundraising and fund disbursement functionality using the WePay service as a backend. A working demo will soon be available at http://demo.inncrisis.com/\r\n\r\nFunctionality we aim to implement in the future:\r\n* Administration tools for tracking donations\r\n* Native mobile apps for fund dispersal by aid workers\r\n* A way for donors to get feedback on the impact of their donation\r\n\r\nIf this project proves to be a viable platform for deployment by aid agencies, future developments may include a mobile web app interface for aid workers to search for and directly book hotel rooms using the funds that have been raised via their agency's deployment of InnCrisis.\r\n\r\n###History\r\nThe InnCrisis project began it's life on 3 November 2012 at the [HurricaneHackers](http://hurricanehackers.com) [CrisisCamp Boston](http://wiki.crisiscommons.org/wiki/Boston) event held at the MIT Media Lab. In the aftermath of hurricane Sandy, the NYC Office of Emergency Management had put in a request for a hotel availability platform to streamline the process of sheltering people displaced by disasters like hurricane Sandy.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate aftermath of a natural disasters it can be a challenge for response agencies to find shelter for people who have been displaced. It's often the case that emergency shelters reach capacity while nearby hotels have excess capacity. A bunch of us at the November 3rd event started hacking away at an easy system for aid workers to place people in nearby hotels. At the end of the event, we decided we had a pretty cool fundraising solution forming that we wanted to continue working on.\r\n\r\nThe current dev team for InnCrisis is Ryan Kahn (@Myztiq), Jonathan Wilde (@speedbreeze) and Lyre Calliope (@CaptainCalliope).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
